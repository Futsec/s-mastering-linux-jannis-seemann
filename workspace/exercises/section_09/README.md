##### Exercise Material: Webserver Log File Analysis

1. How many requests have downloaded .zip-files?
2. How many different .zip-files have been downloaded?

###### Tip:
- You can detect Firefox users by their user agent, it contains "Firefox/".
- You cant fully parse the logfile as a logfile, you might have to treat it as a line of text, and for example match the user agent on the whole line of text.
