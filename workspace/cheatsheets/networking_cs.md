### What is the Internet

The _internet_ is a network of networks, an interconnected set of nodes which form a mesh and are able to communicate with each other.
We can build a connection with pretty much any other computer on a network, without having a dedicated connection to the device.
We do this through the use of packets which gets assigned an IP address.
