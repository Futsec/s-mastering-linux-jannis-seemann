### Command Information & Help
---

To find more information about a command, we can use various other commands such as `man`, `help`, or even `--help`. However, how do you know which to use for which command?
For that we use `type` and we will see that some commands are either _shell built-in_ or its a _/usr/bin_ command. _Shell Built-in_ commands do not have man pages, so using `help` or `--help` is the only way of getting more info on a command.

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`type`|Displays information about a command type.|[View](#type)|
|`man`|an interface to the system reference manuals.|[View](#man)|
|`help`<br>`--help`|Display information about builtin commands.|[View](#help)|
|`apropos`|search the manual page names and descriptions.|[View](#apropos)|

#### type
```sh
    type cd
    type mkdir
```

#### man
```sh
    man mkdir
    man -k "execute command"
```

#### help
```sh
    help cd
```

#### apropos
```sh
    apropos "execute command"
```

### File & Folder Management
---

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`touch`|We use the touch command to create files, we can can create single or multiple files.|[View](#touch)|
|`mkdir`|We can us mkdir to create folders, either single or multiple, as well as entire folder structures.|[View](#mkdir)|
|`mv`|The move command can both move and rename files.|[View](#mv)|
|`cp`|This copies files, it can also copy a file with one name, and paste it as another name.|[View](#cp)|
|`rm`|The remove command, removes files only, however it can remove directories if not careful.<br>_This command doesnt completely remove the file from disk, it might not be in your trash, but it is still recoverable using some apps._|[View](#rm)|
|`rmdir`|Remove Direcctory is much like the `rm` command but for **empty** directories. If a directory is not empty, it will fail.|[View](#rmdir)|
|`shred`|Overwrites a file to hide its contents, and optionally delete it.|[View](#shred)|
|`gpg`|OpenPGP encryption and signing tool. Allows for encrypting your files.|[View](#gpg)|
|`ln` _Hardlink_<br>`ln -s` _Softlink_|These allow us to both create hard & softlinks, Hardlinks cannot point to a directory, while softlinks can point to files and directories.<br>Hard & softlinks point to the same inode, difference being when removing the original file, hardlink will retain the data as its pointing to the same inode, while softlinks will not as its just a reference to the path.<br>Think of hardlinks as a way making copies, as it points to the inode its basically another file on disk, pointing to the same inode as the original file, while softlinks are a type of shortcut that reference the path to an inode.|[View](#ln)|

### Data Processing & Filtering
---

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`tee`|The `tee` command allows to redirect stdin to two places, example to the terminal and to a file.|[View](#tee)|
|`sort`|`Sort` sorts the contents of a file, by default it sorts aphabettically.|[View](#sort)|
|`uniq`|The `uniq` command list only the unique values of a file, however, the file needs to be sorted first, as the `uniq` command only checks the lines subsequent to it, or directly under it. This is why people usually run `sort` and then pipes that stdout to `uniq`.|[View](#uniq)|
|`grep`|`grep` allows us to search for patterns within a file or whatever is parsed to its stdin.|[View](#grep)|
|`strings`|Prints the sequences of printable characters in files such as binary files.|[View](#strings)|
|`tr`|`tr` which stands for **tr**anslate, translates/modifies a string of characters to something else, it works on a character level, meaning 'ab' 'cd', a will be change to c and b will be change d. We can also remove characters using `-d`, as well as work with ranges.|[View](#tr)|
|`rev`|`rev` reverses a string.|[View](#rev)|
|`cut`|`cut` allows us to modify a string by cutting out byte, characters or fields for a specific range.|[View](#cut)|
|`sed`|The `sed` tool allows us to quickly execute commands on a file or stdin. Example of how the commands would work is `sed 'command1; command2; ...'` and they allow us to do things such as `delete lines` or `insert lines` or whatever other command is available to us.|[View](#sed)|

#### tee
```sh
    ping google.com 2>&1 | tee -a ping_info.txt

    echo "awesome" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
    echo "Try removing the spaces inbetween" | tr -d ' '
```

#### rev
```sh
    echo 'Was it a cat I saw?' | rev
```

#### cut
```sh

### User Management
These next few commands will require some knowledge on what roles `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow` & `/etc/group` play. 
As well as, looking at the three main groups of users and groups, there can be more depending on your system or OS. 

#### /etc/passwd 
Contains basic user account information.
```md
    cat /etc/passwd
    user:x:1000:1000:User:/home/user:/bin/bash
      |  |   |    |    |       |         |
      |  |   |    |    |       |         Login Shell (Users default shell)
      |  |   |    |    |       Home Directory
      |  |   |    |    GECOS (Comment - usually full name or description)
      |  |   |    Group ID (GID)
      |  |   User ID (UID)
      |  Password Placeholder (Real password stored in /etc/shadow)   
      Username (Login name)    
``` 

#### /etc/shadow
Stores encrypted user passwords and password aging information.The file is only readable for the root user or users with elevated priviledges.
The encryption used on passwords here are known as `bcrypt`.

```md
    cat /etc/shadow
    user:$6$hD...:20346:0:99999:7: : :
      |       |       |  |   |   | | | |
      |       |       |  |   |   | | | Reserved for future use.
      |       |       |  |   |   | | Account expiration date (blank - no expiration).
      |       |       |  |   |   | Inactive days after expiration (blank = disabled).
      |       |       |  |   |   Warning days before password expires.
      |       |       |  |   Maximum days password is valid.
      |       |       |  Minimum days before password can be changed again.
      |       |       Last password change.
      |       Password hash.
      Username.
``` 

#### /etc/group
```md
    cat /etc/group
    user:x:1000:
      |   |   |  |
      |   |   |  Group Members.
      |   |   Group ID (GID).
      |   Password placeholder (group passwaords are rarely used, stored in /etc/gshadow).
      Group Name.
```

#### Users on Linux 
- Root user &rarr; _The Root User has the Highest priviledges, indicated by the UID of 0. There can only be one root user._
- Standard User &rarr; _Limited Priviledges, Can temporarily gain administrative priviledges._
- Service User &rarr; _Limited Priviledges, users for specfic tasks, often not needing a GUI, e.g maintaining a Web Server._
- Groups &rarr; _All users must have a primary group, and can be assigned zero to unlimited additional groups._

#### Groups on Linux
- root &rarr; _The superuser group with administrative priviledges, allowing complete control over the system._
- sudo / wheel &rarr; _Members can use `sudo`. May also be called wheel on other unix operating systems._
- adm (admin) &rarr; _Members are allowed to read log files._
- lpadmin / lp &rarr; _Members can manage printers & print queues (CUPS). May also be called "lp"._
- www-data &rarr; _A group for web server processes (such as Apache or Nginx), gives access to web content._
- plugdev &rarr; _Allows users to manage pluggable devices (USB Sticks, External HHDs...)._

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`useradd`|We can create users using `useradd`.|[View](#useradd)|
|`passwd`|We can set the user password using `passwd`.|[View](#passwd)|
|`usermod`|We can modify another users details, including ourselves, but its best we logout to do  that.|[View](#usermod)|
|`userdel`|We can delete users from the system using the userdel command.|[View](#userdel)|
|`groups`|We can view ours or other users groups using this command.|[View](#groups)|
|`adduser`<br>`deluser`|These are some additional commands for debian users, this is another way of handling the operations of adding and removing users from groups.|[View](#adduser)<br>[View](#deluser)|
|`groupadd`|Can add our own groups, incase we want to define our own permissions.|[View](#groupadd)|
|`groupmod`|We can change or edit group information|[View](#groupmod)|
|`groupdel`|We can remove our custom groups using this command|[View](#groupdel)|
|`su`|Allows us to switch the user, su stands for 'Switch User'.|[View](#su)|
|`sudo`|Superuser do, gives temporary elevated priviledges of the root user to a standard user, however there is more to sudo when it comes to its options. Take a look at the `/etc/sudoers` file using the command `visudo`, as there is more configurations one can do within the file, it is also the reason why %sudo has the ability to elevate priviledges for certain users that are part of %sudo.|[View](#sudo)|

### File Permissions & Access Control
---

In Linux, file permissions are divided into 3 categories, Owner(u), Group(g) and Other(o). 
We can see this when listing files, for example this file.

```sh
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 owner group  18K Sep 21 17:53 bash_commands_cs.md

    -(rw-)(rw-)(r--)
    |  |    |    |
    |  |    |    Other(o)
    |  |    Group(g)
    |  Owner(u) 
    File type
```

#### Types of permissions
You can set file permissions symbolically or numerically.

- Read (r / 4) &rarr; The ability to read a file or list a directory.
- Write (w / 2) &rarr; The Ability to modify a file or creating or deleting files in a directory. _This also needs the execute permission enabled._
- Execute (x / 1) &rarr; Allows running the file as a program or changing into & traverse this directory.

```sh
      Read
      |Write
      ||Execute
      |||   
    -(rwx)(rw-)(r--)
      |||  ||   |
      421  42   4 
       7    6    4
```

#### Understanding umask in Linux
Umask is a Linux setting that defines the default permissions removed from new files and directories. New files start with 666 and directories with 777; the umask “masks out” bits to make them more restrictive. For example, a umask of 022 produces files with 644 and directories with 755.

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`chmod`|Sets the permissions on files or directories.|[View](#chmod)|
|`chown`|Sets the owner and group of a file.|[View](#chown)|
|`umask`|Sets the baseline security for files and directories. You can configure this umask value within your `login.defs` file, dor system wide rules, or use umask for the current session, or you can configure it in `.bashrc` file.|[View](#umask)|

#### chmod
```sh
    chmod u+rwx file.txt                         # rwx    = 7
    chmod g+rw file.txt                          # rw     = 6
    chmod o+r file.txt                           # r      = 4
     ↪ chmod 764 file.txt
             |||
             ||Other(o)
             |Group(g)
             Owner(u)

    chmod 777 -R ./directory
```

#### chown
```sh
    chown user:group file.txt
     ↪ chown root:root file.txt

    chown user:group -R ./directory
```

#### umask
```sh
    umask
    umask 0002                                   # 664 > -rw-rw-r--
    umask 0022                                   # 644 > -rw-r--r--
    
    chmod +t ./folder/
     ↪ This sets the sticky (0)002 value for directories only, giving further permissions, for the owner to be the only person that can remove files or directories. 
    
    chmod u+s ./python3
    chmod u+S ./python3
     ↪ -rwsr-xr-x                                # (SUID) Set User ID + executable
     ↪ -rwSr-xr-x                                # (SUID) Set User ID + Not executable

    chmod g+s ./python3
    chmod g+S ./python3
     ↪ -rwxr-s-r-x                               # (SGID) Set Group ID + executable
     ↪ -rwxr-S-r-x                               # (SGID) Set Group ID + Not executable
```

### Linux Processes
---

#### Process states
- R &rarr; _Running State._
- S &rarr; _Sleeping (An Interruptable State)._
- D &rarr; _Uninterruptible Sleep State._
- T &rarr; _Traced or Stopped State._
- Z &rarr; _Zombie Process State_

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`ps`|Stands for **Process Status**, Displays information about running processes.|[View](#)|
|`nice`<br>`renice`|You can change the scheduling priority of a program by setting its "niceness". The range of niceness is from -20 to +19, with the default being 0. The lower the niceness e.g -20, the more priority a program takes, while a higher niceness e.g +19, the less priority it takes.<br>With renice, we can change the priority of a program that is already running.|[View](#nice)<br>[View](#renice)|
|`kill`|&#8226; Used to send signals to a process, this is usually done using the `kill` command. Use the link provided to practice this comamnd: `https://downloads.codingcoursestv.eu/055%20-%20bash/wget/download-slow`.<br>_Link provided from the course._|[View](#kill)|
|`killall`|kills the all the processes with a given name, e.g firefox. killall default signal is also SIGTERM.<br>Very similar to `kill -s SIGTERM $(pgrep -f firefox)`.|[View](#killall)|

### Job Control
---

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`&`|Using the ampersand symbol at the end of a command, we can background a running process. This allows us to have or regain control of our terminal while a process is running, especially if it takes a long time.|[View](#ampersand)|
|`jobs`|This is how we can list the active jobs in our terminal.|[View](#jobs)|
|`fg`|Used to bring a background job to the foreground.|[View](#fg)|
|`bg`|Used to send foreground jobs to the background. This in combination with `Ctrl + Z`, to suspend or stop the process in the fg and we can then use `bg %[job-ID]` to continue the job in the background, same with `fg %[job-ID] &`.|[View](#bg)|
|`kill`|We can also kill a job, using the `kill` command, followed by the job number.|[View](#kill-job)|
|`stty`|Is a tool to change / print the terminal line settings, we can use the option `tostop` & `-tostop` to activate or disable having commands suspended if its output is being printed to the terminal.|[View](#stty)|
|`wait`|Waits for a background job to complete before doing _xyz_ for example.|[View](#wait)|
|`nohup`|We can use `nohup` to launch a program that will remain open|[View](#)|

### Package Management
---

#### Adding custom repositories
- /etc/apt/sources.list 
- /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources
- add-apt-repository [/remove] PPA:.../...

These are the locations where you will add custom repositories for third party software. When adding repositories, you 
usually add a gpg key alongside it, given by the developer. Adding third party repositories can be a serious security risk, 
as the gpg key gives that source the ability to push malicious code unto your system.

_Usually you dont have to worry about entering this manually or making a file manually, as most third party places 
provide a piece of code that does this for you._

#### Types of repositories
|domain:|Free Software|Non Free Software|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Officially supported by Cononical|main|restricted|
|Community Supported/<br>Third Party Software|universe|multiverse|

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`lsb_release`|Linux System Base commands helps us to identify which distrobution we have. Prints distrobution specific information.|[View](#lsb-release)|
|`dpkg`|The Debian package manager is responsible for handling the install of software, the packages are distributed as `.deb` files. It does not install the dependencies for the software.<br>Packages may be found at [here](packages.ubuntu.com)|[View](#dpkg)|
|`apt`<br>`apt-get`|`apt` & `apt-get` builds upon dpkg allowing us to install dependencies. Both use repositories also known as package sources. `apt-get` checks more stable repositories, and therefor its best  practice to use within scripts. `apt` API & parameters change on the fly if necessary.|[View](#apt--apt-get)|
|`debsums`|Check the md5 sums of installed packages against verified sources. Helps to identify if specific software has been changed.|[View](#debsums)|

#### lsb release
```sh
    lsb_releases -a
```

#### dpkg
```sh
    dpkg -i [package]
     ↪ -r                                        # Removes a package.
     ↪ - dpkg-reconfigure                        # Re-runs the configuration script of a package.
```

#### apt & apt-get
```sh
    apt                                          # General in terminal use.
    apt-get                                      # For use when scripting.

    apt update
     ↪ apt-get update                            # This updates the information on your local machine to be up to date with its repositories.
      ↪ upgrade                                  # Upgrades packages and system if need be.
      ↪ apt full-upgrade                       
       ↪ apt-get dist-upgrade                    # Different for apt & apt-get, but they do essentially the same thing, which a more asserted version of upgrade, whereby it forces the change of dependencies and software by either installing them or removing them.
      ↪ apt autoremove                           # Removes binary package dependencies that are no longer required. Otherwise known as orphaned dependencies.
      ↪ apt remove                               # Removes the binary package but leaves the configuration files behind.
       ↪ apt remove --purge                      # Removes the binary package as well as the configuration files.
     ↪ apt show                                  
      ↪ apt-cahce show                           # Both show  information such as dependencies for an application. Just apt show is for apt, while apt-cahce is for apt-get.
     ↪ apt install -f                            # Fixes a package that might have been installed incorrectly.
```

#### debsums

### System Boot Process & Systemd

> ❗**IMPORTANT** _Come back to this section after course is complete to gain a better understanding of systemd._

#### The Bootloader _GRUB2_
This comes after the BIOS/UEFI, the bootloader is the first software to run with the goal of loading the operating system.
It loads the **kernel** into memory and hands over control. The bootloader is active for a very short time.

We can change the configuration of GRUB in `/etc/default/grub`, once changes are made, we need to then update the grub for changes to take affect using `sudp update-grub`.

#### The Kernel
The kernel controls the scheduling, resource allocation, as well as inter process communication or **(IPC)**. Handles memory management, filesystem management, the networking stack and hardware abstration layer.

In the most basic terms, the kernel is a bridge between hardware and software. We can use `lsmod` to list the currently loaded modules within the kernal.

#### Systemd
Systemd is a system and service manager that provides features for managing and controlling the state of the system and its components.

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`lsmod`|Shows the status of modules in the Linux Kernel.|[View](#lsmod)|
|`systemctl`|Control the systemd system and service manager|[View](#systemctl)|
|`systemd-cgtop`|Show top control groups by their resource usage|[View](#systemd-cgtop)|
|`journald`<br>`journalctl`|Print log entries from the systemd journal, this is a replacement for syslog.|[View](#journald)|

#### lsmod
```sh
   lsmod
```

#### systemctl
```sh
    systemctl                                     
     ↪ systemctl list-units                      # List the units under systemctl
    systemctl {status, start, stop, restart, reload} [UNIT] # Basic use of starting and stopping a unit, such as an apache2.service
    
                                                 # There is a lot more to systemctl, such as making your own service, having timers and schedulers.
                                                 # However, complete the course and come back to this because right now, it serves no purpose.
```

#### systemd-cgtop
```sh
    systemd-cgtop                                # This shows the cgroups or control groups for a unit.
```

#### journald
```sh
    journalctl                                   # Shows all the logs.
    journalctl -b                                # Shows the current boot log.
    journalctl --list-boots                      # Shows all the available boots, each having their own ID, which will increment after every boot.
     ↪ journalctl -b -34                         # Shows the boot log for said boot ID.
    journal -u [UNIT]                            # Filter logs by Units.
     ↪ journalctl -u apache2.service
     ↪ journalctl -u apache2.service --since '2023-04-18' --until '2023-04-23' # Filter by date range.
    journalctl -r                                # Reverse the output order, where latest entry is first.
    journalctl -f                                # Follow the log in realtime, outputs only the most recent entries.

    echo 'journald is amazing' | systemd-cat     # You can log a message to the logs.
     ↪ echo 'journald is amazing' | systemd-cat -t 'me' # You can log a message to the logs while adding an identifier for your service or application.
```

### Integrate and Manage Filesystems on Linux
#### _Volumes, Partitions & Mounts_

#### Partition Tables

|Label|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|MBR|Master Boot Record|Older partitioning scheme, which is limited to 4 primary partitions & limited to 2 TiB disk space.|
|GPT|GUID Partition Table|Modern partitioning scheme, supports up to 128 primary partitions as well as larger disk space.|

#### Most Common Filesystem (_Linux_)
|Filesystem|Operating System|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|**ext3**|Linux|Older journaling filesystem, mostly replaced by ext4.|
|**ext4**|Linux|Default filesystem for most modern Linux distributions.|
|**XFS**|Linux|High-performance filesystem for large files and scalability.|
|**Btrfs**|Linux|Advanced filesystem with snapshots, checksums, and volume management.|
|**FAT32**|Windows, Linux, macOS|Legacy filesystem; great compatibility but limited to 4 GB file sizes.|
|**exFAT**|Windows, Linux, macOS|Designed for flash drives; handles large files and cross-platform use.|
|**NTFS**|Windows|Default Windows filesystem; supports permissions, encryption, journaling.|
|**ReFS**|Windows|“Resilient File System,” designed for data integrity and high reliability (Windows Server).|
|**APFS**|macOS, iOS|Apple File System; default for modern Apple devices, supports encryption and snapshots.|

#### Partitioning Drives
We can use both graphical software such as gparted or a CLI version named parted to partition or manage our creation of our drives.

#### Mounting a Drive
To find the device we want to mount we can use the `lsblk -f`, once found, we need to make a folder for the device to mounted to in `/mnt/name-of-folder`
and then mount it using `mount [device] [mount_point]`. We can unmount the same device using `umount [Device] or [Mount_Point]`, example, `umount /dev/sdb` or `umount /mnt/backups`. 

When mounting there are a few options we can use when specifying the  `-o` option, they are `ro, rw(_default_), noexec, nosuid, noatime`.


|Options|Description|
|:---|:---|
|**ro**|Read Only.|
|**rw**|Read + Write. (_Default_)|
|**noexec**|Disables execution of executable files.|
|**nosuid**|Disables the set-user identifier and the set-group identifier.(_Can be a security issue_)|
|**noatime**|Does not update the access time when a file is accessed.|

|Command|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`gparted`<br>`parted`|A partition manipulation program, either graphically or within the terminal.|[View](#parted)|
|`mkfs`|Builds a Linux filesystem, This mkfs frontend is deprecated in favour of filesystem specific mkfs.type utils.|[View](#mkfs)|
|`lsblk`|Lists block devices.|[View](#lsblk)|

#### Parted
```sh
    sudo parted                                  # You enter the parted application without referring to a device.
    sudo parted [device]                         # You can enter parted with a specific device or drive selected.
     ↪ sudo parted /dev/sdb
```

#### mkfs
```sh
    sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1                     # Creates a filesystem for the partition if one was not made already during parted.
```

```sh
    lsblk -f                                     # List Block Devices With -f shows the filesystems.
```

#### mount

```sh
    sudo mkdir /mnt/mount_point_name             # First you need to make place for where to mount the drive.
    sudo mount [device] [mount_point]            # Basic command format.
     ↪ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/backups         # Example of mounting a partition to a mount point named backups.

    sudo mount -o {ro,rw,noexec,nosuid,noatime}  # Mounting with options.
     ↪ sudo mount -o ro,noexec,noatime /dev/sdb1 /mnt/backups
```

#### umount
```sh
    sudo umount [device]                         # You can unmount a drive either by using the device path or...
     ↪ sudo umount [mount_point]                 # You can unmount a device by its mount point.
```
