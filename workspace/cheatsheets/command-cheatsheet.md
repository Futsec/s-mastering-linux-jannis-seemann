#### ❓ File Infomation
##### wc
_`wc` returns the amount of either lines, words or chars/bytes within a file._

```sh
    wc ~/file.txt
    wc -lwc ~/file.txt 
     ↪ -l       |lists the amount of lines
     ↪ -w       |list the amount of words
     ↪ -c       |lists the amount of chars, or bytes of the file
```

##### du
_Disk Usage shows how much disk usage the file is using, there are specific units that this is measured in._

```sh
    du ~/file.txt 
    du -h file.txt
     ↪ -s       |display only a total for each argument
     ↪ -h       |display in human-readable format
     ↪ -k       |display block size
```

#### 📈📉 Data Processing & Filtering
##### tee
_The `tee` command allows to redirect stdin to two places, example to the terminal and to a file._

```sh
    ping google.com 2>&1 | tee -a ping_info.txt
```

##### sort
_`Sort` sorts the contents of a file, by default it sorts aphabettically._

```sh
    sort file.txt
     ↪ -r       |sorts contents of file in reverse order
     ↪ -n       |sorts contents in reverse order
     ↪ -c       |check whether contents of file is sorted & find unsorted elements
     ↪ -k       |column number sort data by a specific column
     ↪ -u       |checks unique values only
```

##### uniq
_The `uniq` command list only the unique values of a file, however, the file needs to be sorted first, as the `uniq`
command only checks the lines subsequent to it, or directly under it. This is why people usually run `sort` and then 
pipes that stdout to `uniq`._

```sh
    sort file.txt | uniq
     ↪ _sort -u file.txt_
```

##### grep
_`grep` allows us to search for patterns within a file or whatever is parsed to its stdin._

```sh
    ls | grep -F "file.txt"
    ip addr show | grep -F "inet"
                 | grep -E "[a-z][A-Z][1-9]"
                    ↪ egrep "[a-z][A-Z][1-9]" 
```

##### tr
_`tr` which stands for **tr**anslate, translates/changes characters to something else, it works on a character level, 
meaning 'ab' 'cd', a will be change to c and b will be change d._

```sh
    echo "bash" | tr 'ba' 'di'
```
