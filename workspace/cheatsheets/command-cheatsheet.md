     ↪ -l       |lists the amount of lines
     ↪ -w       |list the amount of words
     ↪ -c       |lists the amount of chars, or bytes of the file
```

##### du
_Disk Usage shows how much disk usage the file is using, there are specific units that this is measured in._

```sh
    du ~/file.txt 
    du -h file.txt
     ↪ -s       |display only a total for each argument

     ↪ -n       |sorts contents in reverse order
     ↪ -c       |check whether contents of file is sorted & find unsorted elements

     ↪ -u       |checks unique values only
```

##### uniq
_The `uniq` command list only the unique values of a file, however, the file needs to be sorted first, as the `uniq`
command only checks the lines subsequent to it, or directly under it. This is why people usually run `sort` and then
