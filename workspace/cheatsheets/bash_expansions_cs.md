> ðŸ’¡ **Note on Word Splitting**:
> - _Wordsplitting is when bash uses the variable known as `IFS` to determine spaces, tabs, or line-breaks when a command is run._
> - _This is why we expand using double quotes, as sometimes not using this can cause unforseen errors. Not only that, but when making file or folder names with spaces, can create unintended files or folder if NO quotes are enclosing the name._


> ðŸ’¡ **No Quotes vs Single Quotes vs Double Quotes**:
> - _cat $PWD/*.txt_
>   - _All Available shell expansionare being applied._
> - _cat '$PWD/*txt'_
>   - _All Expansions are disable, Wordsplitting is disabled._
> - _cat "$PWD/*.txt"_
>   - _Most expansions are disabled, such as filename, tilde and brace expansions, however variable and parameter expansions are still enabled._
