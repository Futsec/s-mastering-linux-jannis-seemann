> ðŸ’¡ **Note on Word Splitting**:
> - _Wordsplitting is when bash uses the variable IFS to determine spaces, tabs, or line-breaks when a command is run._
> - _This is why we expand using quotes, as sometimes not using this can cause unforseen errors. Not only that, but when making file or folder names with spaces, without a space, this can create unintended files or folder if no quotes are around the name._


> ðŸ’¡ **No Quotes vs Single Quotes vs Double Quotes**:
> - _cat $PWD/*.txt_
>   - _All Available shell expansion are being applied._
> - _cat '$PWD/*txt'_
>   - _All Expansion are disable, Wordsplitting is disabled._
> - _cat "$PWD/*.txt"_
>   - _Most expansion are disabled, but variable and parameter expansions are still enabled._
