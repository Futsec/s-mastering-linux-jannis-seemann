> ðŸ’¡ **Note on Word Splitting**:
> - _Wordsplitting is when bash uses the variable known as `IFS` to determine spaces, tabs, or line-breaks when a command is run._
> - _This is why we expand using double quotes, as sometimes not using this can cause unforseen errors. Not only that, but when making file or folder names with spaces, can create unintended files or folder if NO quotes are enclosing the name._


> ðŸ’¡ **No Quotes vs Single Quotes vs Double Quotes**:
> - _cat $PWD/*.txt_
>   - _All Available shell expansionare being applied._
> - _cat '$PWD/*txt'_
>   - _All Expansions are disable, Wordsplitting is disabled._
> - _cat "$PWD/*.txt"_
>   - _Most expansions are disabled, such as filename, tilde and brace expansions, however variable and parameter expansions are still enabled._

|#|Type of Expansion|Description|Example|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|EP-01|**Filename** Expansion|This is a file name.|[View](#filename-expansion)|
|EP-02|**Tilde** Expansion|This expands the home path directory, when adding a plus to it is can expand to you current working path.|[View](#tilde-expansion)|
|EP-03|**Variable** & **Parameter** Expansion|These expand variables such as PATH or HOME|[View](#variable--parameter-expansion)|
|EP-04|**Brace** Expansion|Expands strings, it does not work in quotes.|[View](#brace-expansion)|
|EP-05|**Command** Substitution|Allows for commands to to be run and expands its output as a replacement.|[View](#command-substitution)|
|EP-06|**Process** Substituion|Allows us to use the _input_ or _output_ of a process as a temporary file.|[View](#process-substitution)|

##### Filename Expansions
```sh
    ls *
    echo ?.txt
```

##### Tilde Expansion
```sh
    cd ~
    echo ~
     â†ª /home/futsec/
    echo ~+
     â†ª /home/futsec/workspace
```

##### Variable & Parameter Expansion
```sh
    echo "${PATH}"
    echo "${USER}"
```

##### Brace Expansion
```sh
    #{item1,item2}            
    touch data.{csv,txt}
     â†ª data.csv data.txt

    #{start..end}
    echo {a..z}
    touch 'file_'{1..9}.txt
    
```

##### Command Substitution
```sh
    echo "$(tput setaf 7)$(tput setab 3)$Hello, World!(tput sgr0)"
    echo "My current working directory is $(pwd)"
    echo "My current working directory is `pwd`"            #Using back ticks is another sort of syntax for doing command substitution 
```

##### Process Substitution
```sh
    diff <(ls ./folder1) <(ls ./folder2)
    wc -l < <(ls)
    echo "Test" > >(cat)
```
